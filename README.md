# Syx2Ins
This is a command line program that converts any MT-32 SYX system exclusive file into Cakewalk's/Sonar's MIDI Instrument INS file format. This aids tremendously in composing with custom MT-32 timbres with being able to lookup the patch names within the Cakewalk/Sonar sequencer, which in turn aids in creating SCI-ready MIDI files for importing into SCI Companion when making SCI fangames.
